# CapyIO Testing Strategy

## Principles

- Tests prove explicit requirements and failure isolation.
- Core/Protocol/Adapter DTO tests run without hardware.
- Platform and driver claims require identified environments and retained
  evidence.
- Mock UI/Sidecar behavior is visibly simulated.
- Tests are not removed or weakened to hide migration defects.

## Unified commands

```text
cargo xtask doctor
cargo xtask fmt
cargo xtask check
cargo xtask test
cargo xtask validate-docs
cargo xtask validate-manifests
cargo xtask adapter-smoke
cargo xtask ci
cargo xtask demo
```

Frontend uses `corepack pnpm typecheck` and `corepack pnpm build`.

## Foundation unit tests

- Node has no global role and may own Source/Sink Ports;
- Capability/Adapter ownership and duplicate IDs;
- Source→Sink Profile compatibility;
- Source→Source, Sink→Sink and mismatched Profile rejection;
- valid/invalid Route transitions;
- opposite-direction Routes coexist;
- stopping one Route leaves another active;
- Adapter failure affects owned Routes only;
- catalog replacement after Adapter restart;
- Protocol catalog/Route/Problem round trips and enum/version failures;
- Adapter manifest validation;
- NDJSON framing, malformed/oversized messages and correlation;
- child stdout machine-only behavior and bounded stderr;
- deterministic UI snapshot with four Routes.

## Deterministic integration tests

Fixtures use HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 and vivo X200 Pro mini with no environment
or hardware reads. Tests register both catalogs, open a Session, prepare/start
opposite-direction Routes, stop one, simulate Adapter/peer loss and assert
ordered bounded events/snapshots.

## Sidecar smoke test

Adapter Host launches repository-built mock binaries, performs initialize,
probe, catalog, Route prepare/start/stop and shutdown, then verifies exit and
stderr/stdout separation. A second case simulates abnormal child exit and checks
scoped Failure/Problem behavior. Finite mock payloads are not performance tests.

## Later platform tests

- Android: actual sensor/audio parameters, permissions, visible service,
  lock/background, focus, route changes and power saving;
- Windows user mode: endpoint enumeration, Broker restart, bounded IPC and
  sleep/resume;
- drivers: install/update/remove, service restart, reboot and project-only
  Verifier in an isolated VM/dedicated target;
- end to end: IMU Panel/Recorder, audio both directions, camera, gamepad,
  independent Routes, disconnect/reconnect and clock epochs.

## Data and timing quality

Signal tests measure latency, clipping, gaps, discontinuities, loss/repeat and
RMS. Drift tests record source/sink samples, queue water level and resampling
ratio rather than inferring drift from acoustic latency. Sensor tests preserve
clock domain, sequence, units, coordinate frame, accuracy and calibration.

## Evidence format

```text
test-results/<run-id>/
  manifest.json
  summary.md
  config.json
  metrics.jsonl
  runtime.log
  adapter-stderr.log
  platform/device inventories as applicable
  input/output recordings only when explicitly authorized
```

`manifest.json` records Git commit, versions, OS/device, Route/Profile/backend,
network mode, case and timestamps.

## CI policy

Required before merge: Rust format, check, Clippy warnings denied, tests,
Protobuf build, docs/repository validation, manifest validation, Adapter smoke,
frontend typecheck/build and dependency/license review when dependencies change.
Hardware jobs may be manual but must attach evidence. Claims match actual runs.
