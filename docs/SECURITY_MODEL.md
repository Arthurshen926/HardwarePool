# CapyIO Security Model

> Status: pre-alpha threat model. Production pairing/cryptography are absent.

## Protected assets

- live audio/video, input events, location and sensor data;
- actuator/haptics/control commands;
- node identity, trust records, pairing/session secrets;
- Capability/Route authorization and system Projection availability;
- Adapter executable integrity and child-process control;
- host stability, especially OS services and kernel components;
- recordings, diagnostic logs and test artifacts.

## Actors and trust boundaries

Actors include local user, paired peer, unpaired peer, compromised paired peer,
malicious local process, administrator, faulty/malicious Adapter, UI/WebView and
supply-chain attacker. Pairing does not authorize every Capability.

```text
untrusted network -> authenticated control/data -> Node Runtime
Node Runtime -> Adapter Host -> Sidecar/external service -> platform/driver
UI WebView -> allow-listed local API -> Node Runtime
```

## Principal threats and controls

### Unauthorized sensors/actuators

Capability/Route-scoped requests, provider confirmation, expiring leases,
immediate revoke, visible platform lifecycle and persistent use indicators.
Microphone/camera/screen capture never starts silently.

### Eavesdropping, injection and replay

Production paths require mutual authentication, authenticated encryption,
Session/Route/epoch binding, replay windows, fresh keys and version binding.
The current Mock/Sidecar loop is local test behavior, not a secure network.
The Gate 5 SensorServer `ws://` protocol Adapter is likewise restricted to an
explicitly approved trusted lab. A Tailscale address can protect overlay transit
but does not supply CapyIO Capability authorization, application identity,
message replay protection or downgrade binding.

### Adapter process abuse

Versioned manifests, allow-listed entrypoints, bounded NDJSON, correlation
limits, stderr-only logging, timeouts, least privilege and ownership-scoped
failure. A manifest is not a sandbox; production distribution additionally
needs signing and provenance.

### UI command abuse

Narrow DTO commands, Rust-side validation, CSP, no remote WebView content and no
arbitrary shell/filesystem/updater plugin in the foundation.

### Kernel compromise

No network, DNS, pairing, crypto negotiation, JSON/Protobuf, codecs or reconnect
logic in drivers. Kernel IPC is fixed/bounded and validated. Driver tests and
Verifier run only in an isolated approved target.

### Denial of service and stale state

Bound message/queue/event/log sizes, rate/deadline limits, disconnect cleanup,
fresh epochs, bounded child shutdown and safe OS endpoint behavior when user-mode
processes disappear.

### Supply chain

Pinned toolchains/lockfiles, dependency review, provenance manifests, retained
licenses/notices, SBOM/signing before release and no secrets in untrusted builds.

## Authorization tuple

```text
requesting_node
providing_node
capability_id / port_id
route_backend and constraints
session_id
issued_at / expires_at
```

Opposite-direction or compound-device Routes have independent grants and may
partially fail.

## Logging/privacy

Default logs may include typed IDs, states, timings, counters and sanitized
errors. They exclude raw content, pairing codes after use, private/session keys,
tokens, unrelated process lists and personal filenames. Recordings are explicit
artifacts with retention/deletion policy.

## Milestones

1. Foundation: deterministic validation and process boundaries.
2. Local real-Adapter lab: clearly marked insecure/local mode.
3. Pairing spike: device identity and authenticated transcript.
4. Production transport: encryption, replay and downgrade binding.
5. Projection/driver hardening: ACLs, isolated tests, fuzzing and review.
6. Release: signing, SBOM, vulnerability and update process.

No build before milestone 4 is described as safe for untrusted networks.
